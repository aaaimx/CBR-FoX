Overview
========

CBR-Fox is an advanced **Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) library** that enables users to analyze and compare cases using various similarity metrics. It is designed to work efficiently with structured data, time-series cases, and customizable distance functions.

What is Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)?
-----------------------------------
CBR is an AI approach where past experiences (cases) are used to solve new problems. It is widely applied in **recommendation systems, decision support, predictive analytics, and anomaly detection**.

Why Use CBR-Fox?
----------------
- **Efficient Case Retrieval**: Uses multiple similarity metrics to find the most relevant cases.
- **Customizable Distance Functions**: Define your own case similarity measures.
- **Integration with sktime**: Supports time-series similarity analysis.
- **Easy Visualization**: Includes tools for plotting similarity results.
- **Flexible & Extensible**: Designed for scalability and integration with existing ML pipelines.

Example Use Cases
-----------------
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Retrieve similar past cases based on patient history.
- **Fraud Detection**: Compare new transactions against previous fraudulent patterns.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Identify potential equipment failures by analyzing historical sensor data.
