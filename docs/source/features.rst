Features
========

CBR-Fox provides a variety of features to facilitate Case-Based Reasoning.

## 🔹 Core Features
- **Flexible Similarity Computation**: Uses Pearson correlation, Euclidean distance, and custom metrics.
- **Support for Time-Series Data**: Integrates with `sktime` to handle temporal similarity.
- **Built-in Visualization**: Provides plotting utilities for case comparison.
- **Batch Analysis**: Process multiple cases efficiently.

## 🔹 Custom Distance Functions
CBR-Fox allows users to **define custom similarity functions** for tailored comparisons.

Example:
```python
from cbr_fox.custom_distance import cci_distance
similarity = cci_distance(case1, case2)
```
